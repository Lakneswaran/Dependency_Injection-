# Dependency_Injection-

- If we are using extend a class we are copying a entire class and from there we adding extra features.
- From dependency Injection we are putting in a class constructor. the class we are working is dependant on 
- the injected classes. We can inject many classes as we want and create a new class from it. 

- Setter Injection
- Interface Injection
